    <h2>Cities</h2>

    <h3>Data Sources</h3>

    <article>
      <header><strong>NYS Comptroller (OSC) — City Financials</strong></header>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/local-government/data">NYS Office of the State Comptroller</a>
        collects Annual Financial Reports (AFRs) from local governments across New York State.
        NY Benchmark imports this data for all 62 cities. Of these, 61 have filed at least once
        since 1995. The remaining city — New York City — has its own Comptroller and
        is not part of the OSC reporting system. We plan to import NYC data from
        <a href="https://www.checkbooknyc.com/">Checkbook NYC</a> in a future release.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of the most recent filing year (2024), 57 cities have submitted data. Four cities are
        <a href="/non-filers">late or non-filing</a>.
        The OSC dataset includes revenue, expenditure, and balance sheet data at the fund and
        account-code level, totaling over 647,000 individual observations.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <header><strong>US Census Bureau (ACS)</strong></header>
      <p>
        Population, income, poverty, and housing data comes from the
        <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs">American Community Survey</a>
        (5-year estimates) via the Census Bureau API. This covers all 62 cities (including NYC)
        since 2012, totaling over 14,000 observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        ACS 5-year estimates are based on survey samples and carry margins of error.
        For small cities, these margins can be significant. We use point estimates
        throughout the application.
      </p>
    </article>

    <h3>How City Metrics Are Calculated</h3>

    <p>
      The three headline metrics used in city rankings and entity dashboards are derived
      from OSC and Census data:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Fund Balance %</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Unassigned Fund Balance (account code A917) divided by Total Expenditures, expressed
        as a percentage. A higher fund balance generally indicates stronger fiscal reserves.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Debt Service %</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Total Debt Service (all accounts in the Debt Service category) divided by Total
        Expenditures, expressed as a percentage. A lower percentage typically indicates
        less debt burden.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Per-Capita Spending</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Total Expenditures divided by population (from Census ACS data). Provides a
        normalized comparison of spending across cities of different sizes.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>All-Fund Approach</h4>
    <p>
      Expenditure and revenue totals include all fund types (General, Highway, Water, Sewer,
      Enterprise, etc.) with two exclusions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Trust & Custodial Fund (T-fund)</strong> — Cities in Westchester and Nassau
        counties act as tax collectors for county and school district taxes. These pass-through
        amounts are reported in the T-fund and can inflate apparent expenditures by 40-50%.
        We exclude the entire T-fund to remove these pass-throughs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interfund Transfers</strong> — When cities move money between funds, OSC
        reports these as expenditures ("Other Uses") and revenues ("Other Sources") at the
        fund level. Cities' own ACFRs eliminate these in government-wide statements. We do
        the same to prevent double-counting.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Fund Structure Variation</h4>
    <p>
      Cities organize their finances differently. Some run water and sewer operations through
      the General Fund (A), while others use dedicated Enterprise (E), Water (F), and Sewer (G)
      funds. Debt service may appear in any fund. The all-fund approach handles this correctly
      by including all legitimate spending regardless of fund structure.
    </p>

    <h3>City Data Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Late and non-filing cities</strong> — Not all cities file their Annual Financial
        Reports on time. Four cities are currently late, with the most significant case being
        Mount Vernon, which lost its credit rating due to years of non-filing.
        <a href="/non-filers">View filing compliance details</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NYC not yet included in OSC data</strong> — New York City operates under its own
        Comptroller and does not file with the OSC. NYC data will be imported from Checkbook NYC
        in a future release.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GASB 54 and fund balance classification</strong> — The "Unassigned Fund Balance"
        metric (account code A917) only exists from 2011 onward, when GASB Statement No. 54
        reclassified fund balances from Reserved/Unreserved into Nonspendable, Restricted,
        Committed, Assigned, and Unassigned categories. Some cities also reclassify fund
        balance between categories year to year. For example, Buffalo reported no Unassigned
        Fund Balance for 2018-2020, instead categorizing its entire General Fund balance as
        Assigned or Restricted during those years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Early year coverage</strong> — Data coverage is sparser in the earliest years
        (1995-2000) as fewer cities had filed electronically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Census margins of error</strong> — ACS 5-year estimates are survey-based and
        carry margins of error, particularly for smaller cities.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <%# ── School Districts ────────────────────────────────────────── %>

  <section>
    <h2>School Districts</h2>

    <h3>Data Sources</h3>

    <article>
      <header><strong>NYS Comptroller (OSC) — School District Financials</strong></header>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://wwe1.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/findata/financial-data-for-local-governments.cfm">NYS Office of the State Comptroller</a>
        publishes annual financial data for all ~691 school districts in New York State.
        NY Benchmark imports this data from fiscal year 2012 to present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike city data (which uses a long format with one row per account code), school district
        data is published in a wide format — one row per district per year with approximately
        180 columns representing pre-aggregated category totals covering revenue by source
        (property taxes, state aid, federal aid), expenditures by function (instruction,
        administration, transportation, debt service), balance sheet items, enrollment,
        and property values.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <header><strong>NYS Education Department (NYSED) — Outcomes Data</strong></header>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php">New York State Education Department</a>
        publishes assessment results, graduation rates, and enrollment demographics for all
        school districts. We have downloaded graduation rates (2012–2025), Grades 3–8 assessment
        results (2014–2021), and enrollment demographics (2018–2025). Import of this outcomes
        data is planned for a future release.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> 2019–20 state assessments were cancelled due to COVID-19 school
        closures, so that year has no assessment data.
      </p>
    </article>

    <h3>District Types</h3>
    <p>
      New York has five legal classifications for school districts, each with distinct
      governance and fiscal structures:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Central</strong> (~550 districts) — The most common type. Consolidated districts
        serving multiple municipalities, typically in rural and suburban areas. This category
        includes "Independent Superintendent" and "Central High" variants, which share the same
        legal structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Union Free</strong> (72 districts) — Independent districts formed by vote of
        multiple school districts, typically in suburban areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>City — Big Five</strong> (4 in OSC data) — Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and
        Yonkers. These districts are fiscally dependent on their parent cities — their budgets
        require city approval. NYC is also a Big Five district but operates under its own
        Comptroller and is not in OSC data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>City — Small City</strong> (57 districts) — Districts coterminous with smaller
        New York cities (population under 125,000). While they have some fiscal relationship with
        their city, they have greater budgetary independence than the Big Five.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Common</strong> (10 districts) — The oldest form of school district in New York,
        governed by trustees rather than a board of education. These range from 7 to 229 students.
        Despite the name, they are not one-room schoolhouses — they operate modern facilities but
        retain the historic "common school" designation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How School District Metrics Are Calculated</h3>
    <p>
      The headline metrics used in <a href="<%= school_districts_compare_path %>">school district
      comparisons</a> are:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Per-Pupil Spending</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Total Expenditures divided by Enrollment. The primary measure for comparing spending
        across districts of different sizes.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Per-Pupil Instruction</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Instruction expenditures divided by Enrollment. Isolates spending that directly supports
        classroom teaching.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Per-Pupil Administration</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Administration expenditures divided by Enrollment. Measures administrative spending
        relative to student body size.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Administrative Overhead %</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Administration expenditures divided by Total Expenditures. Measures how much of the
        budget goes to administration versus instruction and other services.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>State Aid Dependency %</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Total State Aid divided by Total Revenue. Measures fiscal independence — higher values
        indicate greater reliance on state funding and more vulnerability to state budget cuts.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Big Five: Separate Data, No Double-Counting</h3>
    <p>
      The Big Five school districts (Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers) are fiscally dependent
      on their parent cities, which raises a natural question about whether importing both city and
      school district data leads to double-counting. It does not — OSC assigns entirely separate
      municipal codes and financial reports to cities and their school districts. We verified this
      by comparing FY 2024 expenditures:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buffalo — city operations: $896M, school district: $1.28B</li>
      <li>Rochester — city operations: $908M, school district: $1.08B</li>
      <li>Syracuse — city operations: $507M, school district: $624M</li>
      <li>Yonkers — city operations: $925M, school district: $830M</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In three of four cases, school district spending exceeds municipal operations spending.
      We link Big Five districts to their parent city entity to reflect the fiscal dependency
      relationship.
    </p>

    <h3>Exclusions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>BOCES</strong> — Boards of Cooperative Educational Services are regional
        shared-service providers. They don't serve students directly and have no enrollment
        figures for per-pupil calculations. Districts that use BOCES services report those
        costs as expenditures in their own filings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Charter schools</strong> — Not included in OSC's school district bulk data.
        NYSED tracks charter schools separately under different financial reporting requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NYC Department of Education</strong> — Not in OSC data. NYC operates under its
        own Comptroller. NYC school data will be imported from a separate source in a future release.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>School District Data Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pre-2012 data unavailable</strong> — OSC's school district bulk downloads begin
        in 2012, unlike city data which goes back to 1995.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>District mergers</strong> — A small number of districts have consolidated over
        time (e.g., Berkshire, Elizabethtown-Lewis, Westport). We do not currently track
        historical lineage — each year's filing stands alone under the district name that filed it.
        We hope to cover these mergers soon, not because they involve large numbers of students,
        but because they may serve as useful case studies for other districts considering
        consolidation — particularly around whether economies of scale produce cost savings
        without detrimental impact to outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Outlier districts</strong> — A few districts have unusual structures that produce
        extreme per-pupil figures. For example,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryas_Joel_School_District">Kiryas Joel Village Union Free School District</a>
        reports ~$385,000 per pupil because it operates exclusively as a special education
        provider for a community where most children attend private religious schools. Its
        176-student enrollment counts only the public special education program, while
        expenditures cover services for the broader community.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enrollment timing</strong> — OSC enrollment figures are point-in-time snapshots
        that may differ slightly from NYSED's audited enrollment counts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NYSED outcomes not yet imported</strong> — We have downloaded graduation rates,
        assessment results, and demographics from NYSED but have not yet integrated them into
        the application. This is planned for a future release and will enable spending-vs-outcomes
        analysis.
      </li>
    </ul>

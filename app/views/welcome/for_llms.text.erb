## Data Model

Entity: A government body (city, school district, county).
Document: A source document (ACFR, budget, census) with fiscal year.
Metric: A standardized datapoint definition (expenditures, population, bond rating).
Observation: An extracted fact linking Entity + Document + Metric with page citation.

## Key Principles

1. Every datapoint traces to a source document and page number.
2. Primary sources (ACFRs, audits) over secondary summaries.
3. All observations start as "provisional" until verified.
4. Full audit trail for all changes.

## Current Scope

- Focus: New York State cities (62 total)
- Expanding to: school districts, counties, towns
- Status: Alpha release with live data

# New York Benchmarking Project - Data Application - LLM Context

> Data collection, validation, and analysis engine.

## About This Application

This is the data application for the New York Benchmarking Project, a civic-tech Rails application for collecting, verifying, and benchmarking financial and operational data from New York State local governments.

The application ingests financial documents (ACFRs, budgets), extracts standardized metrics, and provides a rigid audit trail for data integrity.

## Project Identity

- Official Name: New York Benchmarking Project
- Tagline: Civic reform through benchmarking
- App Tagline: Data collection, validation, and analysis engine

## Data Model

### Entity
A government body (city, town, school district). Entities may have parent-child relationships representing fiscal dependency. Example: Yonkers Public Schools is fiscally dependent on the City of Yonkers.

### Document
A source financial or statistical document (PDF or URL) tied to an entity and fiscal year. Types include ACFRs, budgets, census data, crime statistics.

### Metric
A standardized definition of a datapoint with:
- Label (human-readable name)
- Value type (numeric or text)
- Display format (currency, percentage, integer, decimal, text)
- Unit (optional, e.g., "USD", "per capita")

### Observation
A single extracted, citable fact linking:
- Entity (who)
- Document (source)
- Metric (what)
- Value (numeric or text)
- Page reference (citation)
- Verification status (provisional, verified, flagged)

## Verification Workflow

All observations start as "provisional" and must be verified against source documents. The verification cockpit displays the PDF alongside the form for side-by-side verification.

## API Access

This application does not currently expose a public API. Data is accessed through the web interface. Future API access is planned.

## Technology Stack

- Framework: Ruby on Rails 8
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Kamal on DigitalOcean
- Storage: DigitalOcean Spaces (S3-compatible)
- PDF Viewing: PDF.js

## Data Principles

1. Every datapoint must trace to a specific document and page
2. Primary sources (ACFRs, audits) preferred over secondary summaries
3. Conservative interpretation over aggressive normalization
4. Verification status tracked for all observations
5. Full audit trail via PaperTrail

## Current Coverage

- Pilot cities: Yonkers, New Rochelle (and expanding)
- Document types: ACFRs, budgets, census, crime data
- Metrics: Expenditures, revenues, population, bond ratings, and more

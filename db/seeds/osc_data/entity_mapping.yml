# OSC Entity Mapping
# Maps OSC MUNICIPAL_CODE and ENTITY_NAME to database entity names
#
# Naming convention: OSC uses "City of X", database uses "X"
# Import logic: entity_name = osc_row["ENTITY_NAME"].sub("City of ", "")

# Cities present in OSC data (57 cities)
# Format: municipal_code => { osc_name, db_name, county }

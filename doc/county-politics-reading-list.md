# County Politics Reading List

Background reading for understanding NY county partisan politics, weighted voting, and governance structures. Relevant to the county partisan scatter charts and historical election data sourcing (TODO #26).

## 1. The Foundational Theory (The Math)

To understand why "one supervisor, one vote" was thrown out, you must read the original papers that defined the Banzhaf Power Index.

- **"Weighted Voting Doesn't Work: A Mathematical Analysis"** by John F. Banzhaf III (*Rutgers Law Review*, 1965).
  > This is the seminal paper. Banzhaf (then a young lawyer) used the Nassau County Board of Supervisors as his primary case study to prove that weighted voting often leaves small districts with 0% real power.

- **"Game Theory and Strategy"** by Philip D. Straffin.
  > A standard textbook that provides a very accessible chapter on "Voting Power." It uses the New York examples specifically to teach the difference between the Banzhaf Index and the Shapley-Shubik Index.

## 2. The Legal Precedent (The History)

These sources document the "one person, one vote" revolution that forced New York counties to change their structures.

- **"Banzhaf v. Adams" (1967):** This is the landmark New York court case. Searching for the legal filings or summaries of this case will show how the court accepted mathematical "voting power" as a legal standard for representation.

- **"The Original Banzhaf Power Index Problem"** (Archived by Wyoming County, NY).
  > Many "Board of Supervisors" counties keep a technical memo in their archives explaining their specific weighted formula. Wyoming County has a particularly clear public document explaining their allocation.

## 3. The Data Gold Standards (The Records)

For the raw numbers of who sat on which board and what their party was, these are the only "official" historical records:

- **"The New York Red Book" (Published annually since 1892):**
  > This is the "Who's Who" of NY politics. It contains lists of county officials, their party affiliations, and portraits of leadership for every year of your 1994-2026 timeline.

- **"Manual for the Use of the Legislature of the State of New York" (The Blue Book):**
  > Published by the NY Secretary of State. This is the official state directory that includes the seat-by-seat composition of county boards.

---

## 4. Governance & Advocacy (The Context)

These resources explain how these boards actually function today and why some counties resist switching to a legislature.

- **"County Government Organization in New York State"** (NYSAC, 2023 Refresh).
  > Published by the **New York State Association of Counties**. This is the most current guide on which counties use which system (Charter vs. Non-Charter) and how their boards are structured.

- **"Decennial County Legislature Redistricting in NYS"** (NYSAC Presentation).
  > A technical guide often used by county attorneys to explain how they must recalculate their Banzhaf weights every 10 years following the Census.

## 5. Accessible Civics

- **League of Women Voters of NYS (LWVNY):** Their "Impact on Issues" and "New York Government" guides are specifically designed to help citizens understand why local representation looks so different from county to county.

---

## 6. Articles on NY Partisan Shifts

- "New York's Republican Crack-Up" (2001) — https://www.city-journal.org/article/new-yorks-republican-crack-up
- "The Decline of the Republican Party in New York State" (2011, URI honors thesis) — https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=srhonorsprog

---

## Next Steps

- Contact **New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC)** to see if they have a consolidated spreadsheet of the current Banzhaf weighted-vote formulas for the 16 "Board" counties.
- The Red Book and Blue Book are the best sources for historical seat-by-seat partisan composition data needed for TODO #26.
